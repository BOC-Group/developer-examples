# Contributing and participating in this project to integrate our BOC Group software products
This GitHub project does not focus on our products themselves, but it aims at the **integration** of our products via REST APIs.
Therefore we ask you to contact the BOC Group directly in case of bugs/problems in our tools (via e-mail, hotline service, etc.).

For issues regarding the integration code of our products, please follow this guideline.

## Contributing your own coding examples to our repository
If you'd like to add your own code to our project repository, don't hesitate to create a pull request.
For easy maintenance, readable code, simple modification, please read and apply the concept of [Clean Code by Robert C. Martin](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/clean-code/9780136083238/chapter01.html).

## Issue reporting
You can use our issue reporting for the following event types:
* Questions
* Requests (e.g. for further coding examples), bugs/problems and security incidents

First of all, please ensure always that the issue was not already reported by searching on GitHub under Issues.

### Questions
Please describe your issue as detailed as possible. You should also explain why you need an answer to this question.

### Requests for further coding examples
Let us know if you want to extend your code with further examples. It is also possible to request other programming languages than those offered in our public repository.

### Reporting a bug or a security incident
#### What is a bug?
Bugs are defects in the software that are not working as expected. This can also be performance issues.
#### How to report bugs?
It is important that bugs contain a clear **description** of the error including a guide and/or code snippet on **how to reproduce** the issue (if possible).

In addition to this, the following information can be helpful:
* Proper title to see what is the problem at first glance
* Product (ADONIS, ADOIT)
* Affected product version (can be found e.g. on login screen)
* Log files (e.g. SIP, Web server logs folder: <Apache Tomcat installation directory>\logs)
* Reproduction data (library, models/objects, migration package, configuration, mfb...)
