# Reporting a bug
## What is a bug?
Bugs are defects in the software that are not working as expected. This can also be performance issues.
## How to report bugs?
First of all ensure that the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under Issues.

It is important that bugs contain a clear **description** of the error including a guide on **how to reproduce** the issue (if possible).

In addition to this, the following information can be helpful:
* Proper title to see what is the problem at first glance
* Product (ADONIS, ADOIT)
* Affected version
* Which browser was used (especially when it is just reproducible with one browser)
* Log files
* Reproduction data (library, models/objects, migration package, configuration, mfb...)
