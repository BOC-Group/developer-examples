# Contributing and participating in this project to integrate our BOC Group software products
This GitHub project does not focus on our products themselves, but it aims at the **integration** of our products via REST APIs.
Therefore we ask you to contact the BOC Group directly in case of bugs/problems in our tools (via e-mail, hotline service, etc.).

For issues regarding the integration code of our products, please follow this guideline.

## Contributing your own coding examples to our repository
If you'd like to add your own code to our project repository, don't hesitate to create a pull request.
We recommend to follow the concept of [Clean Code by Robert C. Martin](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/clean-code/9780136083238/chapter01.html).

* [Requests](https://github.com/BOC-Group/rest-examples/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature_request.md&title=%5BRequest%5D) (e.g. for further coding examples), [bugs/problems and security incidents](https://github.com/BOC-Group/rest-examples/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBug%5D)

First of all, please ensure always that the issue was not already reported by searching on GitHub under Issues.

It is also possible to request [other programming languages](https://github.com/BOC-Group/rest-examples/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature_request.md&title=%5BRequest%5D) than those offered in our public repository.

### Reporting a bug or a security incident
#### What is a bug?
Bugs are defects in the software that are not working as expected. This can also be performance issues.
